"""Documentation style budgets, enforced. The same checks as Crossband's,
with Woodchuck's own CONVERTED list and completeness guards.

The docs drifted into a house style nobody chose: 73-word average sentences,
caveats stapled to every claim, bug history in reference prose. None of it
was catchable by review because none of it was measurable, so it accumulated
a paragraph at a time.

Two layers. Every markdown file in the repo is held to the hard ceilings: no
em-dash, no 55-word sentence, no 45-word table cell, a heading every 50 lines
of prose. A doc rewritten in the house voice (CONTRIBUTING.md, Writing
documentation) is listed in CONVERTED and is also held to the rules that
guide marks (CI). Taste is not
automatable and is not attempted here: a doc can pass every check and still
fail the guide's one-line test.

Prose measurement excludes fenced code blocks, tables and headings, so a
long SQL line or a wide table never trips a prose budget.

The repo's completeness guards live here too: the docs index links every
doc, and the config reference names every setting the code reads.

(This sentence starts with a bracket.) The app runs (in a way that nobody who
had seen it before would have expected) fine.

NEVER do this. It actually works, honestly, by design, and exactly like that.

So the app waits. Because it can. Since always. Given time. Otherwise not.

It used to be slow. It is no longer slow. Previously it was slow, and it is not
slow any more. See #342.

See the section below, and this page above. The next section says more.

A rather than B, C instead of D, E not just F, and G, not H.

Two things still hold. Three more rules follow.
"""

CLEAN_DOC = """\
# A doc that keeps every rule

Run `a - b; c` and read [docs/CONFIG.md](docs/CONFIG.md). The guide bans
"actually", so it is only mentioned here, in quotes. The API answers on
http://127.0.0.1:8902 in under a second, at 12:30 or any other time.

> Quoted examples count too. This one says "no longer" inside quotes.

<!-- an HTML comment is not prose, so "really" here is never read -->

- Symptom: the app hangs, the log fills, and nothing answers.
- Fix: set `CROSSBAND_PORT` to a free port and run `./start.sh`.
