"""Changelog fragments: two open PRs must never conflict on CHANGELOG.md.

The same tests as Crossband's. Entries ship as one file each
under changelog.d/ and fold into CHANGELOG.md at release, via
scripts/fold_changelog.py, so no two PRs edit the same line. These tests
pin the three things that keep that true: Unreleased gains no new entries
directly, every fragment can fold, and the fold puts fragments where the
reader expects them.
